# C482-Inventory-Management-Application
WGU C482 project that takes a GUI made in SceneBuilder and JavaFx to make non-permanent changes to a default part and product inventory.

When ran this project takes a sample inventory of different parts and products and populates seperate tables for them. From the main screen you can add, modify, and delete items in the inventory. The application does not make permanent changes to the inventory so while there is no practical use, it does display the foundations needed for the C195 project which pairs similar functions with an SQL database.
